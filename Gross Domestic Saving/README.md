# Gross Domestic Savings (% GDP)

I would apply logistic regression, decision tree and support vector machine techniques to predict if the gross national saving is relatively high or low compared to average saving rate in the world (24.79%) for period of 1998-2017. The confusion matrix is used to evaluate the best fit model. Self â€“ Organizing Map is used to cluster the countries based on their economic indicators and test the characteristics of countries which have relatively high and low gross saving (%GDP). This allows us to analyze and compare the financial situation of all countries in the world.
